This repo is based off of the scripts [here](https://github.com/ocean-transport/SWOT-data-analysis) assembled by Jinbo Wang and Tatsu Monkman. The documentation in each Jupyter Notebook file details how to download and process NASA/CNES Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) data to create animated maps of various oceanographic variables.

My contributions involve creating animated maps of sea surface height anomalies for the Pacific off of the California/Western US coast.
